 * corner_map
 * Input: a cube_type string
 * Output: An integer in the range 0 to 88179840-1
 *
 * How this works:
 * First find which permutation the 8 corner cubies are in with respect
 * to their position. There are 8! permutations, and are mapped
 * to a number 0 through 8!-1.
 * To do this, first the inversion vector is computed. Then, the vector
 * is treated as a factoradic number and is converted into decimal.
 *
 * The rotations also need to be factored in. There are 3^7 rotation
 * configurations. Since each rotation is independent (discarding the last
 * cubie which is determined by the other 7) I treat the rotations as a 7 digit
 * number in base 3. It's converted to decimal to get a number 0 though 3^7-1
 *
 * These two numbers are then combined thusly:
 * permutation * 3^7 + rotation
